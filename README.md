## Introduction

This project is dedicated to testing and validating various scenarious using property based testing in Java. It
showcases different algorithms and their usage, providing a practical insight into property based testing with jqwik.

## Examples

* [SHA256Hashing.java](src%2Fmain%2Fjava%2Fcom%2Fwtech%2Fcore%2Fhashing%2FSHA256Hashing.java): Utilizes the SHA-256
  algorithm for hashing passwords. It's a part of the SHA-2 family of cryptographic hash functions but is generally not
  recommended for password hashing due to its speed and susceptibility to brute-force attacks.
* [SHA512Hashing.java](src%2Fmain%2Fjava%2Fcom%2Fwtech%2Fcore%2Fhashing%2FSHA512Hashing.java): Employs the SHA-512
  algorithm. While more secure than SHA-256 due to a larger hash size, it shares similar limitations for password
  security.

## Prerequisites

* Java Development Kit (JDK) - Version 21 or higher.
* Maven - For managing dependencies and running the project.
* An IDE like IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse, or VSCode for editing and running the Java
  files.
* Or simply run it in command line.

## How to Run

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:wallaceespindola/java-property-based-testing-jqwik.git

cd java-property-based-testing-jqwik
```

2. Build the project with Maven:

```bash
mvn clean install
```

3. Running the main examples:

```bash
java -jar ./target/password-hashing-security.jar
```

4. This project is using Java 21, if you want to run it with a previous version, modify the pom.xml and compile to your preferred version:

```bash
<maven.compiler.source>21</maven.compiler.source>
<maven.compiler.target>21</maven.compiler.target>
```

5. You can also run the unit tests for each algorithm on your IDE at the path 'src/test/java'.
